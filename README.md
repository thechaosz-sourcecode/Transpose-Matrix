Transpose-Matrix
================

Here here here.. Let’s discuss again about C++ programming language and topic is Transpose Matrix.

In math, we’ve learned about matrix and how to add two matrix, even for times, divide, and transpose matrix. I have a friend who just started his university life as a computer science major and asked me about how to write transpose matrix using C or C++ language. It sounds so easy for us who already trained well, but for someone who just be in touch on programming world gonna be confused and as his demand, I’ll share my simple code of C++ here !

Hope you got it well and have fun with your program!
